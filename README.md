# Nerdbord JS Weekly Challenge

Welcome to the Nerdbord JS Weekly Challenge! Each week, we'll be publishing a new JavaScript coding challenge in this repository. Each challenge is structured as a separate package, so you can choose which one you want to solve.

## Getting Started

You need to start Nerdbord JS Weekly Challenge on Nerdbord platform, so repository automatically generates for you on your Github account.

Each challenge is located in its own subdirectory under the `packages` directory. To solve a particular challenge, simply navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and follow the instructions provided in related Nerdbord task.

## Updating the Repository

To ensure that you have access to the latest challenges and updates, we recommend updating your forked repository each week against the original repository. Here's how to do it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned your forked repository.
2. Add the original repository as a new remote by running the following command:

    ```shell
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/nerdbord/nerdbord-js-weekly-challenge.git
   
3. Fetch the latest changes from the original repository by running the following command:

    ```shell
    git fetch upstream
   
4. Merge the changes into your local repository by running the following command:

    ```shell
    git merge upstream/main
   
5. Push the changes to your forked repository by running the following command:

    ```shell
    git push
   
6. You can now navigate to the subdirectory of the challenge you want to solve and start working on it.


After following these steps, your forked repository should be up-to-date with the latest challenges and updates from the original repository.
